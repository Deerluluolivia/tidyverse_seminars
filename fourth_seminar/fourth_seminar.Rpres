Functions in R
========================================================

```{r}
my_name <- function(first_name, last_name) {
  paste(first_name, last_name, collapse = "")
}

my_name("Jorge", "Cimentada")
```
  
- You need to pick a name for the function.
- You list the inputs, or arguments, to the function inside function.
- You place the code you have developed in body of the function.  


#### When should you write a function?
Write a function whenever youâ€™ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice.

Functions in R
========================================================

Functions can be used within other functions:

```{r}
my_profile <- function(first_name, last_name, age) {
  paste(my_name(first_name, last_name), "is", age, "years old", collapse = "")
}

my_profile("Jorge", "Cimentada", 26)
```

Functions in R
========================================================

There are a couple of rules that you need to follow when creating functions.

- Everything that happens inside a function (almost) always stays inside a function

```{r, fig.width = 5}
random_num_generator <- function() {
  x <- rnorm(100)
  y <- rnorm(100)
  
  plot(x, y)
}

random_num_generator()
```

Run this and try searching for `x` or `y` inside your working directory.

Functions in R
========================================================

Everytime you call a function, everything that is created inside the function belongs to that functions environment.

Our GlobalEnvironment
```{r}
environment()
```

The environment inside a function (randomly generated)
```{r}
function_env <- function() {
  environment()
}

function_env()
```

After the function ends the new environment is automatically destroyed.

Functions in R
========================================================

Functions created in an interactive R session are stored by default in the `Global Environment`.

```{r}
our_useless_fun <- function() {
  "Our random function"
}
environment(our_useless_fun)
```

How can you tell whether something is a function?

```{r}
class(our_useless_fun)
class(our_useless_fun())
```

Functions in R
========================================================
**Name masking**

Remember this function?
```{r}
random_num_generator <- function() {
  x <- rnorm(100)
  y <- rnorm(100)
  
  plot(x, y)
}
```

- The function will search for `x` and `y` inside the functions environment.
- If it doesn't find it, it will look for the function in the next environment _higher_ up.

Functions in R
========================================================

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
x <- rnorm(100)
random_num_generator <- function() {
  y <- rnorm(100)
  plot(x, y)
}
random_num_generator()
```

### How is the function doing the look up of the variables?

Functions in R
========================================================

Even harder:

```{r, eval = F}
set.seed(1)
random_num_generator <- function() { 
  x <- rnorm(100)
  
  function() {
  y <- rnorm(100)
  plot(x, y)
  }
}

m <- random_num_generator()
m()
```

- Do we get an error?
- Whats the output like?

Functions in R
========================================================

Try this one:

```{r, eval = F}
set.seed(1)
random_num_generator <- function() { 
  x <- rnorm(100)
  
  function() {
  y <- rnorm(100)
  }
  
  plot(x, y)
}

random_num_generator()
```

- Do we get an error?
- Whats the output like?

Functions in R
========================================================

Try this one:

```{r, eval = F}
set.seed(1)
random_num_generator <- function() { 
  x <- rnorm(100)
  y <- rnorm(100)
  
  our_plot <- function() {
  plot(x, y)
  }
  
  our_plot()
}

random_num_generator()
```

- Do we get an error?
- Whats the output like?

Functions in R
========================================================

Some simple rules:

- Functions will look for the required input _inside_ their environment.
- If they don't find it, they'll search in the _parent environment_.
- If they can't find it, they'll search in the _parent environment_ of the _parent environment_.

How do we we know which is parent of who?
```{r}
search()
```

Functions in R
========================================================

We know how functions look up variables, but how do functions look up other functions?

__**Exactly the same way**__

```{r, eval = F}
set.seed(1)

our_plot <- function(x, y) plot(x, y)

random_num_generator <- function() {
  x <- rnorm(100)
  y <- rnorm(100)
  our_plot(x, y)
}
```

It will search the environment of the function and look for `our_plot` and `rnorm`, if not found, it will look in the _parent environment_ and so on..

Functions in R
========================================================
Another rule:
- Everything created in a function gets deleted after the function ends.

_Run this twice_
```{r, eval = F}
j <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}

j()
j()
```

```{r, echo = F}
rm(j)
```
Example taken from: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html

Functions in R
========================================================
Finally, a function *always* returns the last line of code unless specified otherwise.

```{r}
my_fun <- function(x) {
  rnorm(x)
  y <- x
}

my_fun(10)
```

Functions in R
========================================================
We get something in return, which is the last line, but remember that the `<-` operator doesn't print the results.

This way we can see the return of the function:
```{r}
print(my_fun(10))
```

What if we want to return some value from the middle of the function?

Functions in R
========================================================

We use the function `return()`

```{r}
our_range <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) == 1) {
    return(x)
  }
  print("This shouldn't print!")
  c(min(x), max(x))
}

our_range(1:10)
our_range(5)
```

When `return()` is used, the function only runs until `return()` and simply returns that value.

Functions in R
========================================================

Let's get some practice. This is how you calculate the variance of a series of numbers.

</div>  
  
  
### Let's start with everything inside the parethesis of the numerator

Functions in R
========================================================

- Create a vector called `x` which has a `rnorm(100)` inside. With this we'll generate `100` random numbers with a normal distribution.  

- Let's subtract each `x` from the `mean(x)`. This will give us the deviations from the overall mean.  

- Understand the contents of `x - mean(x)`

Functions in R
========================================================
### Answer:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
x - mean(x)
```

- Wrap `x - mean(x)` in parenthesis and raise it to the second power (`^2`)
- Wrap the previous expression in the `sum()` function to get the sum of squared deviations.
- Save that expression with the name `deviance_sq`.

Functions in R
========================================================
#### Answer:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
deviance_sq <- sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)
```

We have the numerator done! Let's finish the denominator.

- Take the `length` of `x` minus `1` and save it with a name `denominator`.


Functions in R
========================================================
#### Answer:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
deviance_sq <- sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)
denominator <- length(x) - 1
```

Let's finish the formula by dividing `deviance_seq` by the `denominator`.

Functions in R
========================================================
### Answer:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
deviance_sq <- sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)
denominator <- length(x) - 1

our_result <- deviance_sq / denominator
```

Let's confirm that our results are correct:

```{r}
c(our_result = our_result, R_result = var(x))
```

Functions in R
========================================================

Now comes the cool part! Lets wrap that into a function.

The skeleton of a function is:

```{r, eval = F}
your_function_name <- function(your_argument1, your_argument2, etc..) {
  Body of the function
}
```

- Call your function `our_variance`
_ Set `x` as the first and only argument of the function.
- Include the calculate of `deviance_sq` and `denominator` in the body of the function
- Make sure to return `deviance_sq / denominator` as the last line in your function (without saving it to any name)

Functions in R
========================================================
### Answer:

```{r}
our_variance <- function(x) {
  
  deviance_sq <- sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)
  pen_length <- length(x) - 1
  
  deviance_sq / pen_length
}
```

- Save the function by running it either in the console or in the script.
- Try it out!

```{r}
set.seed(2)
x <- rnorm(100)
our_variance(x); var(x)
```

- Extend this to create the standard deviation
- Extend this to create a confidence interval variable that returns either both bounds or the chosen bound.
- Introduce loops (VERY briefly) and then the map function with vectors (by puting functions as the varying values)
- Extend map to dataframes and lists (this is when you include your PISA examples.)
- Introduce linear and non-linear modeling with the pipe and broom.
- Visualize one example of model for each country.
