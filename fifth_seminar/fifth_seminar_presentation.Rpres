Philosophy of reproducibility
========================================================

- Reproducible research is about communicating what you have done in your work.

Benefits of reproducibility:

- It would provide greater transparency
- It would allow others to more easily build on what was done in an analysis
- It would make it easier to understand what common elements there were across many different data analyses
- It would make it easier to teach data analysis in a systematic and scalable way
- It will help you understand what you did before

What is Rmarkdown?
========================================================

In short, Rmarkdown is a package that allows to write text and code in the same document.

Markdown is lightweight markup language with plain text formatting.

Does anyone know Markdown?

R markdown example
========================================================

[Checkout this example](https://cimentadaj.github.io/tidyverse_seminars/fifth_seminar/presentations/airtime.html)

R markdown example
========================================================

Let's create our own report.

In the menu:
File -> New file -> R markdown

R markdown example
========================================================

[Let's learn some things about Rmarkdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cimentadaj/tidyverse_seminars/master/fifth_seminar/fifth_seminar.Rmd)

R markdown exercises
========================================================

Next you have to pick one of the datasets presented here and generate an R markdown that has at least:

- 3 graphs
- 2 tables (this could be something like a data frame with summarized statistics)
- Comment on each of these graphs/tables
- Introduce in-line code when commenting.
- Divide your document into sections using the `#` operator


R markdown exercises
========================================================
```{r}
# install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
library(fivethirtyeight)
```
- `Data: congress_age` has an entry for every member of congress who served at any point during a particular congress between January 1947 and Februrary 2014
  - What is the average age in congress for every year since 1947? How does this differ by party affiliation?
  - For every year, which party has the oldest member of congress?
  - For each state, what is the average Republican and Democratic age?
  
use `?congress_age` for a descripton of the data/variables
 
R markdown exercises
========================================================
```{r}
# install.packages("AER")
library(AER)
data(GSS7402)
```
- `Data: GSS7402` is cross-sectional data for 9120 women taken from every fourth year of the US General Social Survey between 1974 and 2002 to investigate the determinants of fertility.
  - What is the average number of children per year?
  - Is there a relationship between number of kids and education? Has it changed over time?
  - What is the average number of children by ehtnicity? How has this evolved over time?

use `?GSS7402` for a descripton of the data/variables

R markdown exercises
========================================================
```{r}
# install.packages("AER")
library(AER)
data(PSID7682)
```
- `Data: PSID7682` is a panel data on earnings of 595 individuals for the years 1976â€“1982, originating from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
  - How has the gender gap in wage evolved over time?
  - Has there been an increase in the average wage over time?
  - Is there a correlation (use the `cor` function) between experience and wage? Has this correlation weakeaned or became stronger over time?  
  
use `?PSID7682` for a descripton of the data/variables
